Apple's iOS 13.7 enables my iPhone to operate software applications, set a user interface, and manage the resources on my iPhone. This latest update allows 
users to opt-in to COVID-19 exposure notifications. This includes the ability for easier contract tracing.

Window's 10 Home on my personal laptop has updates including Window Edge. It also allows users to access battery life, 
volume, connectivity, and the Action Center. Cortana is another addition on the desktop.
